      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What you'll walk away with</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Every participant receives a template AML/CTF Program — including a Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing (ML/TF) risk assessment — that you'll begin customising during the day.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Topics covered include:</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Governance structure</li>
        <li>ML/TF risk assessment (with hands-on template work)</li>
        <li>Personnel due diligence and training</li>
        <li>Customer Due Diligence (CDD)</li>
        <li>Reporting obligations</li>
        <li>Program reviews and updates</li>
        <li>Independent evaluations</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        You'll also receive access to Holley Nethercote's full suite of compliance tools, including registers, checklists, agendas and procedures. Approximately three weeks after the workshop, all participants are invited to a one-hour follow-up webinar to finalise their programs, get answers to any outstanding questions, and receive the latest updates from AUSTRAC.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        VerifiMe will also configure your compliance software to support the key components of the program you develop on the day — so your technology and your obligations are aligned from the start.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <strong>Investment:</strong> $2,000 + GST per practice registration. We're pleased to offer two seats for the price of one — if you'd like to bring a colleague from your firm, both of you are welcome at no additional cost.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <strong>CPD points:</strong> Participants are entitled to 7 CPD units.
